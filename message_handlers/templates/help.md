*The Sysbot automatically generates a wallet address for you on the Syscoin NEVM blockchain.*

To start tipping tokens you need to deposit NEVM Sys into your Sysbot account. This is to cover network fees for each transaction. Please have a minimum of 0.01 SYS in your balance if you plan on using that particular wallet.

*Whitelist*
If you are interested in whitelisting your token on Sysbot, please fill out the short application form found in our [Sysbot landing page](https://sysbot.io). This list is to prevent tokens from having duplicate names, to avoid confusion when tipping or trading.

*Coming soon*
We will also be creating a Syscoin core wallet on the Sysbot with bridge access in order to make transitioning between layers a very simple process.

*Instructions*
Select which wallet you would like to open by pressing the 🏦 `Wallet Info button`.
Check your public deposit address for each layer by pressing the 🔤 `Address button`.
Check the balance of your account by pressing the 💰 `Balance button`.
For full access to your account, press the 🔑 `Private Key button` to see your private keys.

🚨 It is very important to save this private key in case you cannot access your Telegram account for any reason! 🚨

*Disclaimer*
Private keys are managed by Sysbot and securely stored in a database. Sysbot uses the private key to create transactions on your behalf.
Our Developers have access to these private keys to solve problems with the bot or solve stuck trades. We do not recommended to store large quantities of your digital assets on Sysbot.

*About*
Developed by OscorpTech for the Syscoin community.
