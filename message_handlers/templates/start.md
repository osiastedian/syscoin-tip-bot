*Welcome to Sysbot!*

Sysbot is a fast, easy to use, multi-platform payment system on the Syscoin NEVM Network.

Before we set you up with a Sysbot wallet account we need you to confirm you understand a few basic things.

By clicking *“I understand”* you are agreeing to the terms of service and understand that you are responsible for managing your own wallet.

    a. YOU are responsible for monitoring your wallet and safeguarding your Private Key.
    b. NEVER give your Private Key information to anyone. Even if they claim to be support. Scams are everywhere and once you give this information they have complete access to your funds.
    c. To allow for facilitated transfers, tips and airdrops the sysbot does store privatekey information on an encrypted database. We will never access this information for any reason except for transactional purpose. However, we recommend you DO NOT hold large amounts of funds in this wallet.

_I understand that I am responsible for my Private Key information. I understand what a private key is and will never give it out to anyone requesting it._
